# DoubleGoldenApples

This is a Bukkit plugin for Minecraft that adds golden apples that regenerate 4 hearts instead of two. They can only be spawned using a command.

Commands:

/givedoubleapple [amount] [player]

Alias: /giveda [amount] [player]

All arguments are optional (unless executed by the console).
